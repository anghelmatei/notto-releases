## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why do I see a security warning?**
A: Notto is an independent new project and we haven't purchased expensive code-signing certificates yet. The app is completely safe and secure.

**Q: Is my voice data recorded?**
A: Audio is processed for transcription and then discarded. We prioritize your privacy.

**Q: Can I use Notto offline?**
A: Yes! Manual note taking features work offline. AI features require an internet connection (for now, will add local model support in the future).
